# SEO keyword Research

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to capture the logic used to generate the best keywords possible in order to attract a target customer pool to the site ahead of other sites. Once defined, the keywords will be incorporated into the website.

### Personas

The people most likely to search for our site are:

1. Experienced Gardeners - will use the site to search for a specific plant / seed / tree that may not be available locally currently. Or the customer may be in a remote area , far from a garden center and requiring home delivery.
2. Beginner / curious gardeners - these are people that may be watching gardening shows on TV and wondering if they have an interest in gardening and would like to "have a go". These people may be a little nervous about going to a garden center as they may feel they are asking stupid or basic questions. Thus, being able to find what they want, order it and try it is what they are looking for. Other people in this persona may have a very small garden or a few plants and dabble in gardening from time to time, again, they want to see and find something attractive quickly, be able to pay for it and get it delivered to the door.
3. Niche Gardeners - these are people with a specific interest, e.g. I want to grow the hottest chilli I can or I want to grow apple trees etc.
4. Friends / families of gardeners - these are people that may know very little about gardening but will know what their friends / partners like and would be interested in buying gifts around gardening. These gifts tend to be longer lasting and are associated with the gift giver for a long period of time so these people also want to make a statement about their friendship / relationship to the gardener.
5. Random customers - this group may be searching for a gift for a non-gardener or for themselves that is just a bit different from the norm and could be interpreted as thoughtful.
