## Agile Plan

The project was approached as follows;

* Prework was completed as per video around getting ready for PP5. 
* The project was planned over 6 sprints-
  * Sprints 1 - 4 were developing the project in line with boutique-ado
  * Sprint 5 was concerned with developing the 3 custom models and associated views, Templates and Urls
  * Sprint 6 concerned with readme, testing and submission of project.
* Note: the original intention was to have more time to test and write Readme however there were issues / bugs which took up a lot of time.
