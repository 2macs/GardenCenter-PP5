Using a pencil tip or similar, push each seed about 1/4″ into the soil. Cover the seed with surrounding soil, and pat it down gently.\r\nMoisten the seed.

This drains rainwater away from the bud, so none gets trapped on the stem or in a crotch and promotes rotting.\r\nGet the wood deep into the pruners.
