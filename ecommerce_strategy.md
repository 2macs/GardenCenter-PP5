# Online Marketing strategy - Garden Center App

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to docueent the approach to online marketing for the garden center app. At this point in time, the garden center is a smal, family owned business just getting started. The business does have a walk in revenue stream and intent is that online sales will enable the business to reach out to a wider range on nationwide customers.

### Who are the users

1. Experienced Gardeners - will use the site to search for a specific plant / seed / tree that may not be available locally currently. Or the customer may be in a remote area , far from a garden center and requiring home delivery.
2. Beginner / curious gardeners - these are people that may be watching gardening shows on TV and wondering if they have an interest in gardening and would like to "have a go". These people may be a little nervous about going to a garden center as they may feel they are asking stupid or basic questions. Thus, being able to find what they want, order it and try it is what they are looking for. Other people in this persona may have a very small garden or a few plants and dabble in gardening from time to time, again, they want to see and find something attractive quickly, be able to pay for it and get it delivered to the door.
3. Niche Gardeners - these are people with a specific interest, e.g. I want to grow the hottest chilli I can or I want to grow apple trees etc.
4. Friends / families of gardeners - these are people that may know very little about gardening but will know what their friends / partners like and would be interested in buying gifts around gardening. These gifts tend to be longer lasting and are associated with the gift giver for a long period of time so these people also want to make a statement about their friendship / relationship to the gardener.
5. Random customers - this group may be searching for a gift for a non-gardener or for themselves that is just a bit different from the norm and could be interpreted as thoughtful.

### Online platform

For the most part, though not exclusively, the customers are in the age group that still uses FaceBook. The marketing strategy will start with FaceBook and extend to other platforms in the future.

### Business Goals

The goal of the online platform is to expand the reach of the garden center business beyond the current walk in business. The goal is to enable the customer to find the site, like what they see, make a purchase and leave a favourable review. Reviews will be checked and actioned by the business ownership and the business should evolve over time to meet the changing needs of its customers by offering products not currently available ( but requested ) etc.

### Marketing Plan

* Design the site to enable the customer to easily find products of interest , pay for them and receive them and then leave a review.
  * Ensure thorough keyword searches performed.
* Create a FaceBook page to enable visiting the site on tablets etc, this may entice further investigation of the site.
* Create a newsletter detailing what plants etc are in season, any special offers, care points etc.
